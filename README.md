# Exposys_DiabetesPrediction
This is my submission of Notebook, Report, PPT regarding the prediction of diabetes using Machine Learning. 
The tool used is Python. 
A total number of 7 algorithms were used. 
They are: K NEAREST NEIGHBORS, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, RANDOM FOREST, DECISION TREE CLASSIFIERS, GAUSSIAN NAIVE BYERS, XG BOOST ALGORITHMS
The SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE ALGORITHM recorded the highest accuarcy of 79.2 %
